This repository contains analysis of some restraunts in Mexico. The main goal was to answer these questions:
  1. What can you learn from the highest rated restaurants? Do consumer preferences have an effect on ratings?
  2. What are the consumer demographics? Does this indicate a bias in the data sample?
  3. Are there any demand & supply gaps that you can exploit in the market?
  4. If you were to invest in a restaurant, which characteristics would you be looking for?

1) There is one restraunt with the highest score in all fields and 6 in score equal or close to highest. Consumer preferences have decent effect on ratigs raising it at more than 0.3 points or 42%.
2) Young people are the largest part of population given in dataset. The most people are living in San Luis Potosi. Proportions in young, middle age and old people are same in different cities.
3) Mexican cuisine in all sities is in greatest demand and supply. Bars and brewerlies have low demand and high supply, look like young people don't drink much.
4) I've chosen metric number of people on restraunt, as lower it is as prefferetable to us to invest to. The best results are mexican cuisine in San Luis Potosi, Cuernavaca and Ciudad Victoria. Also there's high demand on coffee shop in San Luis Potosi. So this is the good choice as well.
